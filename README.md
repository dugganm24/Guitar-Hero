# MSP430 Guitar Hero
__Project Overview__  
This project involves the development of a Guitar Hero-inspired game on an MSP430 microcontroller. Players use button inputs to match notes in time with a song played through a PWM-controlled buzzer. The game evaluates user input based on timing accuracy and displays the score on an LCD screen. LEDs provide visual feedback, flashing in sync with each note for an immersive experience.

__Project Objectives__    
 - Develop a rhythm-based game using an MSP430 microcontroller.
 - Implement button-based user inputs for real-time interaction.
 - Use a PWM buzzer to generate musical notes.
 - Score user input based on timing accuracy and display results on an LCD.
 - Utilize LEDs to provide visual feedback for each note. 

__Technologies Used__    
 - **MSP430 Microcontroller**: Handles game logic and input processing.
 - **PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)**: Generates musical notes through a buzzer.
 - **Button Inputs**: Captures user interaction for gameplay.
 - **LCD Display**: Shows game score and feedback.
 - **LED Indicators**: Provide real-time visual feedback synchronized with the music.
